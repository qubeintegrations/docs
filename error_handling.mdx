## Overview

When a queued request fails, a webhook is sent to the `webhook_url` you provided with the request. The webhook contains the request ID and the error that occurred.

## Error Types

### `quickbooks_connection_error`

This error occurs when the connection to QuickBooks fails. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as:

- QuickBooks is not running, and the user did not enable "Allow access even when QuickBooks is closed" in the Web Connector
- No company file is open in QuickBooks
- QuickBooks has a modal open, such as a login screen

### `xml_error`

If the QBXML request to QuickBooks was malformed, this error will be returned. This can be caused by:

- Incorrect QBXML structure or tags
- Characters that QuickBooks cannot handle

### `unexpected_error`

All other errors are grouped into this category. Sometimes the user will need to send you the contents of their QuickBooks log file to help you debug the issue.
