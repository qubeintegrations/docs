You'll want a button on your site that says "Connect to QuickBooks Desktop" or something similar. This button should do two things:

<Note>
  Ask the user to start this process from the Windows computer where they have QuickBooks installed. You may wish to warn them they'll be redirected to a qubesync.com to complete the setup.
</Note>

1. Use the `Connections` API to [create a connection](/api-reference/connections/create-a-new-connection) for the customer, and pass a `redirect_url` to redirect them to once they've completed the setup process.
2. Redirect them to the `links.onboarding` url returned with the connection you created.

Once they've completed the short setup process, they'll be redirected to the `redirect_url` you provided with a query parameter `?state=connected` .

<Warning>
  If for some reason they chose to cancel the process, it'll have `?state=incomplete` . Onboarding links expire after 48 hours, and can be [regenerated using the API](/api-reference/connections/onboarding_url). If a user attempts to use an expired onboarding url, they'll be redirected to the `redirect_url` with `?state=expired` .
</Warning>

## Start making requests\!

Use the [pre-built requests](/api-reference/pre-built-queries/query-customers) or build your own using the [Queued Requests API](/api-reference/customers).

## Do you want full control over the onboarding experience?

Instead of using the `onboarding` url, once you've created the connection your user will need two essentials to get set up. Use the corresponding connection endpoints to provide them:

1. [Generate a QWC file](/api-reference/connections/get-qwc-file-for-a-connection) for their web connector and let them download it.
2. [Generate a password](/api-reference/connections/generate-or-set-password-for-a-connection) to enter into their web connector once they've added the QWC file.
