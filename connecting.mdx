## Overview

There are only 3 steps to onboard your customers:

1. [Create a connection for them in QuBe Sync](https://docs.qubesync.com/api-reference/connections/create-a-new-connection)
2. Have them download and open [a QWC file](https://docs.qubesync.com/api-reference/connections/download-qwc) on their QuickBooks machine
3. [Give them a password](https://docs.qubesync.com/api-reference/connections/generate-or-set-password-for-a-connection) to enter into the Web Connector

## Using our pre-built onboarding flow

If you need fine-grain control over the onboarding UI, use the API links above to create your process. If you don't need that much control and want to launch as fast as possible, we've got you covered.

1. [Create the connection](https://docs.qubesync.com/api-reference/connections/create-a-new-connection) as usual
2. Get an onboarding url that you can direct your customer to (or even render in an iframe)
