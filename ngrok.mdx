title: "Receive Webhooks in Development"
---


Use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com), [CloudFlare tunnels](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/) (our preference), or a similar tool to expose your local development environment to the internet. This is useful for receiving webhooks in development. Every request you queue for QuickBooks can have its own `webhook_url` to receive the result of the request.
