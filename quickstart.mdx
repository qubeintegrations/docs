      className="mx-auto"
      style={{ width:"50%" }}
    />

    Usually, this will be done programmatically by posting to the connections endpoint:

    `post https://qubesync.com/api/v1/connections`

### Set up the QuickBooks Web Connector

The Web Connector should come pre-installed with QuickBooks, and allows QuickBooks to communicate with web applications.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Load the QWC File" description="The QWC file tells the web connector how to communicate with QuBe Sync" icon="download">
    Inside the Connection screen, you'll be able to download a QWC File. You'll need to open this file from the Windows computer / VM where you have QuickBooks installed and follow the on-screen prompts. Make sure you have QuickBooks open to the correct company file and we suggest allowing access even when QuickBooks is closed to avoid connectivity issues.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Copy/paste the password" icon="copy">
    Click "Generate Password" to generate a password for the Web Connector and it will be copied to your clipboard. Paste this password in the Web Connector and choose to save it when prompted.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Test the connection" icon="arrows-spin">
    Check the checkbox next to your app in the Web Connector and click "Update Selected". You should see it authenticate and then finish with "No data exchange required" in green if everything has gone according to plan\!
  </Accordion>

### Make Requests

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Get your app's API key" icon="user-secret">
    In the "My Applications" tab, click into the sandbox app. We've generated an API key for you - click to copy it, and have it ready to use in your environment (e.g. `export QUBE_API_KEY="foo..."` )
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Make a request!" icon="code">
    QuBe Sync gives you the full power of any QBXML request, but also has some prebuilt endpoints for common use cases. Here we'll ask for a list of customers

    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash cURL
    export QUBE_API_KEY="..." # get this from My Applications tab
    export CONN_ID="..." # get this from the Connections tab
    
    curl -X POST \
         --url https://qubesync.com/api/v1/connections/$CONN_ID/customers \
         --user $QUBE_API_KEY:
    ```

    
    ```ruby ruby
    ENV["QUBE_API_KEY"]="..."
    
    require 'net/http'
    require 'uri'
    require 'json'
    
    connection_id = "..."
    connection_url = "https://qubesync.com/api/v1/connections/#{connection_id}"
    uri = URI.parse("#{connection_url}/customers?max_returned=10")
    
    request = Net::HTTP::Get.new(uri)
    request.basic_auth(ENV["QUBE_API_KEY"], "")
    request.content_type = "application/json"
    
    response = Net::HTTP.start(uri.hostname, uri.port, use_ssl: false) do |http|
      http.request(request)
    end
    
    # Check the response
    if response.is_a?(Net::HTTPSuccess)
      puts "Request was successful!"
      puts "Response body: #{response.body}"
      # opening the request's page in the browser.
      `open #{JSON.parse(response.body)["data"]["links"]["ui"]}`
    else
      puts "Request failed with status code: #{response.code}"
      puts "Response body: #{response.body}"
    end
    
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

    The response has a link to the request in the UI (`data.links.ui` ) to watch the request as it's processed by the web connector. Hit "Update Selected" on the Web Connector and see your customers\!
