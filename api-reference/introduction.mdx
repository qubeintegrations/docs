## Welcome

The API for QuBe Sync is intentionally small and focused. You **create connections** for your users, **retrieve the QWC File and password** for their web connector, and then **queue requests** for QuickBooks on their behalf. If you provide a `webhook_url` with a request, you'll get the result `POSTed` to that URL.

## Development

If you're using Ruby, you can use the [qube_sync](https://github.com/qubeintegrations/qube_sync_rb) gem to interact with the API, and specify your QuickBooks requests. SDKs for other languages are in the works (please send a support request to [support@qubesync.com](mailto:support@qubesync.com) if you'd like your language to be prioritized). You can also use the OpenAPI spec to generate an SDK to fit your needs, or implement the API directly (it's not hard).

[View the OpenAPI specification file](https://qubesync.com/api/v1/openapi.json)

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using your Application's API key and Basic Auth. The API key should be entered as the username, and the password left blank.

## Webhooks

To protect yourself from timing attacks and other common API vulnerabilities, it's best practice to follow the [Webhooks Guide](/webhooks). It will show you how to verify the webhooks you're receiving are genuinely from QuBe Sync.
