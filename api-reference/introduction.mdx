description: "The QuBe Sync API lets you talk to QuickBooks Enterprise / Desktop with ease."

## Welcome

The API for QuBe Sync is intentionally small and focused. You **create connections** for your users, **retrieve the QWC File and password** for their web connector, and then **queue requests** for QuickBooks on their behalf. If you provide a `webhook_url` with a request, you'll get the result `POSTed` to that URL.

## Development

If you're using Ruby or Python, you can use the corresponding library to interact with the API, and specify your QuickBooks requests.
- [Ruby SDK (qube_sync_rb)](https://github.com/qubeintegrations/qube_sync_rb)
- [Python SDK (qube_sync_py)](https://github.com/qubeintegrations/qube_sync_py)

SDKs for other languages are in the works - please send a support request to [support@qubesync.com](mailto:support@qubesync.com) if you'd like your language to be prioritized. You can also use the OpenAPI spec to generate an SDK to fit your needs, or implement the API directly (it's not hard).

[View the OpenAPI specification file](/api-reference/openapi.json)

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using your Application's API key and Basic Auth. The API key should be entered as the username, and the password left blank.

## Webhooks

To protect yourself from timing attacks and other common API vulnerabilities, it's best practice to follow the [Webhooks Guide](/webhooks). It will show you how to verify the webhooks you're receiving are genuinely from QuBe Sync.
